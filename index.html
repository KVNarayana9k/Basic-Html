        <p>A paragraph is a unit of writing that consists of one or more sentences, all of which relate to the same
            topic. Paragraphs are essential for organizing long pieces of writing such as novels, papers, or even
            emails. Each paragraph should focus on a single topic</p>

        <p>Paragraphs are medium-sized units of writing, longer than sentences, but shorter than sections, chapters, or
            entire works. Because they connect the “small” ideas of individual sentences to a “bigger” idea, paragraph
            structure is essential to any writing for organization, flow, and comprehension.

            need to know about paragraph structure to write like an expert, including several paragraph examples. </p>
